# ExpressJS Blog Website

This project is an ExpressJS-based blog website where users can perform various actions such as user registration, login, create blog posts, like posts, comment on posts, edit their own posts, delete posts, and toggle post visibility between public and private.

**Note:** When visiting this project, please be aware that there might be a slight delay during the initial load, especially if the service has been inactive. This is because Render spins down a Free web service that goes 15 minutes without receiving inbound traffic. Thank you for your patience!
